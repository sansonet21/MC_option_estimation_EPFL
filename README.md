# MC_option_estimation_EPFL
We used Monte Carlo simulation to estimate multiple derivatives products starting from the SP500 pool. We develop our algorithm with both python and c++ to exploit c++ efficiency. We compared our result with real option and we saw that witha threshold of 10000 iterations we get a good approximation of derivative's price
